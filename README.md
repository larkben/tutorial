# Ralph Programming Tutorial

## Follow-Along?

Watch me on youtube.

## @notice
`by cloning this repo you assume all risk associated with it by running shell scripts`

## Scripts

- `stack.sh` - clones the alephium docker devnet stack so you can compile ralph contracts (github required) </br>
- `testnet-tokens.sh` - this will call a curl function to send some alephium testnet tokens to your wallet address </br>
- `setup-variables.sh` - takes in user input to build .env file for you and your project </br>

## Docker - *required*

## Java > 11 - *required*

## Github

In order to run the `stack.sh` script you need to git clone something and thus would require access to the git cli; if you don't have this then download this:
